PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Each month, a small business owner wants a program that generates a profit statement,
  in order to calculate the income earned by the food sales manager.
  The program must ask for the number of food sales, the amount of credit card transactions,
  and the amount of cash transactions, before calculating credit and cash sales. Credit 
  transactions are charged an additional 2.9% fee as well as a $0.30 fee per transaction 
  for using Stripe's Payment Processing system. These fees be removed from the credit sales 
  before combining with the cash sales to determine the food sales, minus fees. A 5.5% sales 
  tax must be removed from the total sales to determine net sales. Monthly purchases are 
  subtracted from the net sales to determine the remaining profit.

Nouns: profit statment, number of food sales, credit card transactions, cash transactions, 
  credit fee, transaction fee, payment processing system, credit sales, cash sales, food sales,
  sales tax, net sales, monthly purchases, profit

Verbs: ask, calculate, remove, combine, determine, remove, determine, subtract
